# PopTracker pack for AP manual Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion

This is a PopTracker package for the manual Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion AP world developed by Kayay.

It features a full map of the game and logic for every location. When connected to your AP slot, you can send checked
locations from PopTracker **without needing to open the manual client**.

Note: Because the AP world doesn't send all of the slot data this pack needs, you will need to set most of the options
by hand. **Do not forget to set the correct goal in the pack**, or else your game may be considered complete too early.
